# Welcome to my Front-end api react project, entitled NC Games.

This is an user interface for web based interaction to look up board game reviews and see comments made by users upon the reviews.

With this you can view reviews in full, then specifically view the detailed contents of one review, view the comments made upon it and also make a comment yourself - so long as you are both logged in and a verified user for the application.

To run this you need only use the website, hosted upon netlify to try the user interface capapbilities.

The matching back-end api to make this run is hosted here [URL](https://github.com/John-Ingham/NC-Games-Back-end)

In code terms the application is built using React.js and with the following added installs; axios, react, react-router-dom. These are the modern, up-to-date programming tools that are used in commercial workplaces and show my knowledge and capability to work with them.

It has an associated back-end api, that you can also find and view on my Github.

Inside each folder there is the details of the design.
Planning, with wireframe models and a tree diagram.
Components, with each sub-item from the webpage.
Css, with the styling used to give the page a bit more life.

## Getting started:

In the terminal run the following commands;
`npm i react` - then;
`npm i react-router-dom`
